This JavaScript project explores the use of callback hell within the context of accounting for a set order of chores and the length of time it takes to perform each chore. As each function within the callback pyramid completes, it calls the next successive chore function. This project then explores the use of Promises embedded in functions instead and utilizing .then and .catch blocks to chain promises together as a more organized means of accomplishing the same thing.
